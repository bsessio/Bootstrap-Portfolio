          <h2>
            About Me
          </h2>
          <hr />
          <img class="img-fluid rounded float-left mr-4 mb-4" src="assets/images/basicportfolio.jpeg" alt="Bowie's Portfolio" />
          <p>
            Born in 1984, on a warm September 4th, within the liberal utopia of
            San Francisco, Bowie Sessions was the child of a married electronics
            engineering professor and his assistant. Fortunately, Bowie was born
            in wedlock and is therefore not a bastard, as both his parents were
            married at the time, to other people.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since that day, Bowie has proved himself a wild, playful, rambunctious
            sort of git, who enjoys frivolity, games, sarcasm, and surprising
            bouts of generosity. A true extrovert, he prospers in the presence of
            literally even a particularly easily anthropromorphized fern.
          </p>
          <p>
            After serving in the US Army as a Combat Medic from 2003-2011, Bowie
            moved from the serenity and poverty of California to the cold and
            economic surplus of Minnesota's Twin Cities for the greatest cause of
            all: love. Wifing his beloved Lynn, they settled into Shakopee with
            their two dogs, while Bowie burned away his soul working for the
            Federal Government within the VA system.
          </p>
          <p>
            Escaping the tedium of government service, he has abandoned almost all
            pretense of success he falsely wove around him and has dove into
            Coding Bootcamp with the intent of actually finding something akin to
            a genuine career that human-sized cheeto puffs can not overly impair.
            Wish him luck!
